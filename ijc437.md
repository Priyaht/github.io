# IJC437 Project – Passenger Assist & Accessibility in UK Rail

## Brief introduction
This project analyses UK rail Passenger Assist data as a quantitative proxy for realised accessibility.
Using official ORR statistics, it examines trends over time and differences across rail operators.
The analysis is implemented using a reproducible R workflow and visualisations.

## Research questions
1. How has passenger accessibility changed over time in the UK rail network?
2. Are there differences in passenger assistance provision across rail operators?
3. Do historical assistance data show patterns that could support trend analysis?

## Key findings
- Passenger assistance demand is generally stable across periods.
- Assistance volumes vary significantly across operators, with higher volumes at major hubs.
- Clear temporal patterns exist, including Covid-19 disruption and partial recovery.
